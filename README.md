## App Refactoring ðŸš€

Your task today:

* Take a look and try to understand what this app is doing. Try to get it running.
* If there are any problems, try to fix them.
* If there is bad code, feel free to refactor it.
* Please tell us what you are doing and what your ideas are, so that we can follow you.
* To run this app you need at best Node.js version `v18.4.0` and npm version `8.19.3` or higher.

A couple of key points:

* This is not a test! There is no "master" solution. We just want to get an overall picture of you working with code.
* Just pretend it is your first working day and this is your task. You can do everything you would normally do (including use Google, Stackoverflow or ask us for help).
* This is supposed to be done in casual conversation, relax and tell us your opinion about the questions.
* We do pair programming here and this interview is not different, so if there is anything you need help with, please ask.
* You can use your favorite IDE.
